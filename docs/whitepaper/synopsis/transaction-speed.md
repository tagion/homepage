# Transaction Speed

_Faster than fast. One of the main reasons current DLT's have failed in mass adaption is their lack of speed. That is not an issue Tagion is facing._

Bitcoin uses 10 minutes on average to validate a transaction. On the VISA network validation takes place in two to three seconds. Transactions are validated in two to three seconds in the Tagion system, putting it on par with VISA in terms of validation speed.

The fast validation time is reached by use of hashgraph for consensus and an efficient patent pending gossip mechanism. The hashgraph algorithm and the accompanying mathematical proof was discovered by Leemon Baird[^1]. 
It solves the Byzantine Generals' Problem, a term that takes its name from an allegory developed to describe a condition, where actors must agree on a concerted strategy to avoid catastrophic system failure, whilst some of the actors are not trustworthy. 

The algorithms makes sure that if more than two-thirds of the nodes in the network follows the same consensus rules, all will, in finite time, reach the same order of events – confirming and validating any action on the network such as a money transfer, money exchange, or data interactions. 

The gossip mechanisms optimise data exchange between nodes to happen most efficiently. This mechanism is patented, and a perpetual license has been given to the Tagion project.
