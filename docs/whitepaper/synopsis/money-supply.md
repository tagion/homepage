# Algorithmic Money supply

_Fractional banking not allowed. Tagion aims to bring trust back to the market and financial systems._

Money is a social phenomenon based on trust in it having future value and being acceptable as payment. Hence a money issuing function is needed that can gain trust by users over time. Trust cannot be gained, if such a function is overly complex and non-transparent or if it relies on external variables from other systems. 

In general, to keep the market stable, a simple modelling of the use of money must be based on internal variables, such as velocity of money (total velocity of Tagions), adoption level, supply of money, average transaction sizes and more. The model can be used as a measure for demand on liquidity and be the basis for whether money needs to be added or removed (burned), to keep the market stable.  

The system burns money every time a transaction is made, and all fees are burned per definition. Rewards are given to nodes, when consensus is reached. If the rewards sum up to more than the burned fees, there is a money increase in the system, and the sum is lower than the burned fees, the opposite is true, i.e. a money decrease.
