# Decentralized Exchange

_DEX allows everyone to make exchanges between supported cryptocurrencies with no mediator._

Tagion has ordering, making it possible to do fair price discovery and price matching decentralised, which when combined with the routing functionality of the Lightning Network, lets the Tagion network accomplish decentralised exchange between Lightning Network compatible cryptocurrencies (Tagions, Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and more). Bids and asks are placed in the network, which gives full transparency and order depth for all users, not limited by a central exchange. 
The Tagion decentralised exchange, DEX, always trades alien currencies against Tagions (TGN), which helps to create high liquidity and thus heightens the matching probability. For example, a user exchanging BTC to LTC means that two exchanges are required. The first is BTC to TGN and the second TGN to LTC. 

The exchange is supported by the guarantee model, where the part selling alien currency locks an amount in Tagions to their corresponding ask. If they then do not fulfil the order on their side by revealing the secret key for the Lightning-network, the guarantee amount is lost to the counterpart, which incentives for the deal to take place. 

It is DEX that orders[^DEX] bid and asks, does price discovery, matchings and settlements. DEX utilises the needed channels and functionality from the Lightning network. It guarantees fair bid/ask price matching and fully decentralised order execution through the use of the latest innovations in the Lightning Network and Tagion that successfully solves the routing problem of the Lightning Network.

Due to the low-level system design, the order placing, and revoking will have some delay, adding friction and making price pumping by large players much riskier, resulting in a healthier balance between small and big traders.
