**CTO and co-founder.**

Carsten is the technical cornerstone of Tagion and responsible for low-level architecture and core network concepts – with more than 20 years of experience in low-level programming and ASIC design it is hard to find a person more capable of the task.
]
Before his Tagion days, he was co-founder and CTO at Polaric Semiconductor, specialising in design and engineering of NFC and Bluetooth microchips and leading an international team of over 15 engineers and chip designers. Prior to Polaric, he designed ASIC chips for Nokia.
Carsten received an M.S. in Electromagnetic Field Theory from the Technical University of Denmark.

Carsten has a brilliant ability to combine deep technological understanding with visions for everyday applications. A talent that made him part of the Giga core team. Giga that later was sold to Intel in one of the biggest acquisitions in Danish business history.

### Kristian Vestergaard

**CCO and co-founder.**

Kristian brings 20+ years of experience as an engineer, software architect and leader to the team. Having started in an IBM's call centre, he quickly raised to software engineer and analyst before working as an external tutor and consultant for IBM and PwC.

His desire to seek new adventures brought him to audio world leader Jabra serving as a Director, Digital Strategist and Architect in Jabra. His knowledge of the informational structures and business understanding earned him a seat at the GN Netcom board.

In the early days of the Tagion journey, he simultaneously worked as GDPR consultant and Enterprise Architect at the largest power producer in Denmark, Ørsted.

His commitment to the project is best reflected in the sacrifices he has brought to the project by working two jobs to fund not only himself but also four further full- time Tagion team members.

Tobias has over two decades of experience in visual communication and marketing in a variety of roles in advertising agencies and large companies, including creative lead, and marketing director.

Stirring a marketing department in growth is no strange thing to him. Before he turned to decentralised networks, he was Marketing Director at ACT.Global. A company that during his stay grew from 10 to 70 employees and moved from one to international seven markets as diverse as India, Thailand and Germany.

Tobias has a degree in graphical communication from Danish School of Media and Journalism and is probably one of the few kids that used to swap away from TV-shows in favour for commercial blocks.
