# Contribute

Tagion should be seen as a common resource, even though it is not fully open yet.

You can contribute to core software, create tooling around Tagion, participate in system design discussions, help improve wiki. Community will be greatful to all meaningful contributions.

## Core software

Currently, [Tagion Node Software](/wiki/terminology.html#tagion-node-software) is closed, mainly because of the lack of documentation and a few legal processes that take time.

If you would like to contribute to the core software, email us to <info@tagion.org> and we will discuss terms. We are prepared to open the code for those who sign NDA.

## Community software

While the source code of the core software is closed, it's quite tricky to create tooling around it, yet if you have an idea, email us at <info@tagion.org>.

All community software will be listed in our wiki.

## Discussions

Feel free to share your ideas and comment on others in our communities. Go to [community page](/wiki/community/), where links to our communities are listed.

We have a long road ahead and a lot to discuss. Now is the time when many important decisions that will affect further Tagion development are made, and you can be part of this process.

## Wiki

The wiki was designed to be a well-organized collection of essential information about Tagion. It is work in progress because Tagion is work in progress.

If you found inconsistent logic, poor structure, other mistakes, please, suggest edits using 'Edit page on GitHub' link to the bottom of every page, or email your notes to <support@tagion.org>.
