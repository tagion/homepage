# Decentralized Exchange

Tagion solves many of the issues found in other major cryptocurrency networks â€“
which opens the door for the creation of more effective decentralised exchanges
between cryptocurrencies.

Currently, many centralised cryptocurrency exchanges offer similar exchange
services such as Bitcoin to USD exchange. There is however no interexchange
market between these institutions and platforms, which means that a price
difference is often to be found on the same currency pair offers, opening up for
arbitrage opportunities. In other words, a Bitcoin could cost 10.000 USD in one
exchange, and 10.110 USD in another, a price difference that can be exploited by
traders.

Decentralised exchanges and protocols such as Atomic Swap with
cryptocurrencies have been created to solve this issue. However, there are still
unsolved problems for this to work such as sufficient liquidity, price discovery and
matching of bids and asks.

There is no collective unit-of-exchange, meaning the number of currency pairs is
very high, effectively evaporating liquidity. More, the matching needs to happen
one-to-one with the size and price, making both price discovery and matching
difficult. Lastly there is no order of transactions in many cryptocurrency networks,
making it impossible to determine a fair way to order bids and asks. The
consequence is dysfunctional systems for carrying out decentralised
cryptocurrency exchanges.

The Lightning Network, supporting among others Bitcoin, is a network that can
route payments between two different accounts connected to the network. This is
done off-chain and only once everything is in place, transactions are triggered on
the blockchain. The Lightning Network can in principle be used to exchange
between two different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Litecoin, by two parties,
providing that the exchange rate is agreed between the two. The Lightning
Network is limited to routing and cannot in itself act as an exchange, as it is
incapable of price discovery and price matching, both necessities for a seamless
exchange to take place.

Tagion has ordering, making it possible to do fair price discovery and price
matching decentralised, which when combined with the routing functionality of the
Lightning Network, lets the Tagion network accomplish decentralised exchange
between Lightning Network compatible cryptocurrencies (Tagions, Bitcoin, Ether,
Litecoin and more). Bids and asks are placed in the network, which gives full
transparency and order depth for all users, not limited by a central exchange.
The Tagion decentralised exchange, DEX, always trades alien currencies against
Tagions (TGN), which helps to create high liquidity and thus heightens the
matching probability. For example, a user exchanging BTC to LTC means that two
exchanges are required. The first is BTC to TGN and the second TGN to LTC.

The exchange is supported by the guarantee model, where the part selling alien
currency locks an amount in Tagions to their corresponding ask. If they then do
not fulfil the order on their side by revealing the secret key for the Lightningnetwork, the guarantee amount is lost to the counterpart, which incentives for the
deal to take place.

It is DEX that orders bid and asks, does price discovery, matchings and
settlements. DEX utilises the needed channels and functionality from the Lightning
network. It guarantees fair bid/ask price matching and fully decentralised order
execution through the use of the latest innovations in the Lightning Network and
Tagion that successfully solves the routing problem of the Lightning Network.
Due to the low-level system design, the order placing, and revoking will have some
delay, adding friction and making price pumping by large players much riskier,
resulting in a healthier balance between small and big traders.

## The underpinning technology

While first generation DLT networks have expanded the possibilities to trade and
transfer money and opened up for the use of Smart Contracts and the execution
of decentralised applications, they have failed in becoming a practical, everyday
tool for transactions, hindering mass adoption. The key areas that must improve
for DLT networks to gain mass adoption are transaction and validation speed,
efficient decentralised data storage, lower energy consumption, and providing
ease of use such as when paying or exchanging from one currency to another.
