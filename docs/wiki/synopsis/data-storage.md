# DART

Distributed Archive of Random Transactions (DART) is built to store and keep track of transactions in the Tagion network. The database efficiently handles the removal and addition of transactions in a secure and distributed manner. Each transaction is stored in a distributed hash-table using a cryptographic hash of the transaction T data. Each transaction is identified
by a unique hash value h. The transaction is put into a table ordered by the numerical value of
the hash.

You can learn more about DART in the [technical paper](/tagiontechpaper.pdf).
