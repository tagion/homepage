## Development

### Run in dev mode

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run in dev mode:
npm run dev
```

### Deployment

```
# In the root folder:
./deploy.sh
```

### Structure

Branch `gh-pages` contains built version of the website, while `source` branch contains the source code.

Site content is in `/docs` folder. Everything else in `/docs/.vuepress`.

We don't use `master` branch since it is indexable by search engines, which makes duplicate content and this is bad for SEO.
