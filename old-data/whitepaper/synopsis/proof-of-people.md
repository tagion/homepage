# Proof of People

_Tagion utilises what is dubbed the Proof-of-People protocol, a heuristic social protocol based on random validation and social components, to achieve a democratic principle of “one person – one node” and “one person – one vote”._

Tagion utilises what is dubbed the Proof-of-People protocol, a heuristic social protocol based on random validation and social components, to achieve a democratic principle of “one person – one node“ and “one person – one vote”. The social component makes it difficult to operate more than one node, while the scoring mechanism reduces the incentive of doing so even more.

Any user can apply to become a node, by following the seven main steps:

1. A user creates a name record in the system to become a public user.
2. When the name record is at least a month old the user makes a node transaction and pays a fee to become a node. The user then participates in the lottery for becoming a node. All participating users will eventually win the lottery.
3. When the user has won the lottery, the user proves to the network that activity has taken place during the past seven days. By doing this, the user also accepts to become a prospect node. The next step is for two current nodes in the system to mate and give the new user - now their offspring - a gene.
4. The prospect engages in a dialogue with three randomly chosen nodes. The three nodes need to socially validate that the prospect is an actual person.
5. The prospect nodes follow the network and earn node reward points until the minimum score is obtained.
6. The prospect engages in a dialogue with two randomly chosen nodes. They should all socially validate the prospect is an actual person.
7. The prospect is now a real node, is given a birth date and an updated gene string in the system and can become an active node.

Each step is designed with a specific function in mind.

The first to steps create an incentive for the user to become a node (public name and recovery of the paid (stacked) fee). The one-month age requirement for the name record introduces a time-lag in the system making it impossible to spin up a lot of nodes overnight.

The lottery makes it random in which order new nodes are chosen again avoiding a person to spin up a large number of nodes in a short period of time. This virtually eliminates Sybil Attacks .

Step 3 ensures that the user is an active participant on the network and not just an inactive lottery ticket. Two nodes verify the node and gives the user a gene by making a mating transaction.

Step 4 is another security check that ensures the prospect node is a real person. All nodes have a name record making it possible to contact each other and engage in a dialogue either by video or chat.

Step 5 is another time-lag, but also a test of commitment. At this stage the node can follow the network and in practice operate the network.

Step 6 is again a second social validation through dialogue.

In step 7 the prospect has become a node and given a birth date and a gene in the system.
