# Democratic Governance Model

_Power concentration made impossible. Tagion’s governance model is based on the ideas and design principles of Nobel Memorial Prize winner in Economic Sciences, Elinor Ostrom._

The Tragedy of the Commons is an economic problem in which every individual has an incentive to consume a resource at the expense of every other individual with no way to exclude anyone from consuming. It results in overconsumption, under investment, and ultimately depletion of the resource.

Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel Prize in Economics, for proving an alternative governance model and through this, disproved, the Tragedy of the Commons.
Her solution is called Self-governance of Commons, which she proved is a more efficient way of governing a common resource. Self-governance of Commons needs a governance system in place, where the beautiful part is that the governance is built to serve the users of the resource and to ensure no conflicts of interest between the actors in the system and the owners of the system.[^1]

The Tagion governance model is designed and built in adherence to these principles.
With the Tagion system a cryptocurrency, Tagions, is introduced. Tagions are non-collateralised money, meaning that the currency is not pegged to other currencies or assets and thereby fully independent from other monetary systems.

As Tagion is an independent monetary system where Tagions are issued and guaranteed by the Tagion network that is owned by its users. In short, the users of the system are also the owners meaning there is no conflict of interest.
